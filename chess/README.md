# King and Pawn Endgame
# Project 1
Did you know Chess has acutally been solved, as long as there are 7 pieces or less on the board?
In this game you get to practice your King and Pawn endgame. They are devilishly tricky. On wrong 
move and your winning position is tainted and vice versa.


For this project I drew a lot of inspiration from the award winning 2016 Go Documentary about the 
how AlphaGo defeated the world champion, Lee Sedol in Go.
